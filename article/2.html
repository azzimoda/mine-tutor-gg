                <h2>Iron-golem farm</h2>

                <p> In Java Edition, a villager can attempt to spawn an iron golem while not having a golem alive within
                    the box of radius 16 blocks around the villager and more than 30 seconds has passed. </p>
                <p> An iron golem needs an available volume in which to spawn. There must be at least 3 transparent
                    blocks above the spawning surface, and that surface must be solid and flat (but not a bottom slab).
                </p>
                <p> Zombies and pillagers nearby increase the spawn rate of iron golems. If a zombie/pillager is seen by
                    villagers, they panic and increase the rate of spawn attempts. Zombies are easier to use as scaring
                    mobs than pillagers, as you'd need a disarmed pillager (one without crossbow) for the farm to work,
                    although pillagers have a much larger range to scare villagers than zombies, also they don't burn in
                    sunlight unlike zombies and won't hurt you if their crossbow breaks. </p>
                <p> Nether portals can also be used to increase rates, since the iron golem cap instantly resets when
                    it's teleported to the Nether. Aside portals, one can also construct a chute where the golems fall
                    into after spawning, which clears the mob cap. This is more reliable than nether portals. </p>
