        <h2>Minecraft Walkthrough</h2>
        <p>
          This page shows you how to use the guides on this site to reach the end of the game and defeat the final boss.
          You can also use the achievements system as a sort of built-in walkthrough, but not all of the achievements
          are necessary.<br>

          The first thing you'll need is to secure a source of food. A simple wheat farm will do the trick - build it
          underground under torchlight for safety.<br>

          It makes sense to also build a safe, underground tree farm. Once you have wood and food sources underground,
          you can stay in your mine until you have iron armour and weapons and a bow and arrows. No need to fight
          monsters n the surface until you're ready.<br>

          Start digging! At first you mostly want iron, for tools and armour and to make a bucket to carry water to
          improve your farm. Next you want to dig down towards bedrock to establish a proper mine. Avoid underground
          structures on the way, or explore them and have adventures, it's up to you. Your main goal is diamonds,
          however, and that means mining or exploring deep underground, near bedrock.<br>

          Once you have diamonds, you can mine some Obsidian, build a Nether Portal and head into The Nether to fight
          some Blazes. Be sure you are well-equipped first: iron or diamond weapons, and a bow and arrows.<br>

          Find a Stronghold and activate the End Portal. You may need to spend some time hunting Endermen at this point;
          that's OK, you're well-armed and armoured by now!<br>

          Equip yourself with top quality armor and weapons. Maybe some potions. And plenty of arrows! Venture through
          the End Portal and take on the Boss.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Iron-golem farm</h2>
        <p>
          In Java Edition, a villager can attempt to spawn an iron golem while not having a golem alive within the box
          of radius 16 blocks around the villager and more than 30 seconds has passed.<br>

          An iron golem needs an available volume in which to spawn. There must be at least 3 transparent blocks above
          the spawning surface, and that surface must be solid and flat (but not a bottom slab).<br>

          Zombies and pillagers nearby increase the spawn rate of iron golems. If a zombie/pillager is seen by
          villagers, they panic and increase the rate of spawn attempts. Zombies are easier to use as scaring mobs than
          pillagers, as you'd need a disarmed pillager (one without crossbow) for the farm to work, although pillagers
          have a much larger range to scare villagers than zombies, also they don't burn in sunlight unlike zombies and
          won't hurt you if their crossbow breaks.<br>

          Nether portals can also be used to increase rates, since the iron golem cap instantly resets when it's
          teleported to the Nether. Aside portals, one can also construct a chute where the golems fall into after
          spawning, which clears the mob cap. This is more reliable than nether portals.<br>

        <h2>2x2 piston door</h2>
        <p>
          To create a 2x2 piston door in Minecraft, players will need the following materials: Redstone dust, four
          sticky pistons, two redstone torches, four pressure plates, and eight blocks of their choice for the frame.
          Once players have gathered all the necessary ingredients, it's time to start building this highly secure and
          cool looking door.<br>

          First, players will want to dig out a hole that is two blocks wide and three blocks in height, going down two
          blocks deep. Next, from the middle of the three blocks, dig out two blocks on each side (still two blocks
          deep). If done correctly, this will look like a "+" sign.<br>

          Next, players will want to dig out one block on each of the "wings" of the hole, at the furthest block on each
          side. Then, place a redstone torch inside the hole. Cover the redstone torch with a block of the players
          choosing. Then, take the redstone dust and place it on each block inside the hole, including on top of the
          ones that are covering the redstone torches.<br>

          Now that players have the redstone in place, they should cover the hole with the blocks of their choice. Next,
          on the blocks near the ones with the redstone dust, players should stack two sticky pistons facing each other.
          Lastly, players should then place the blocks they wish the door to be on the sticky front part of the sticky
          pistons. If done correctly, the door will be closed at this time.<br>

          With the door correctly placed, it's time to activate it. Players should now place pressure plates directly in
          front of the door blocks on each side. If done this way, the door should now open from both sides. With a
          little bit of time and effort, players can make a 2x2 piston door in Minecraft. This project is a great way to
          add some extra security to their home, and it's not too difficult to do.<br>
