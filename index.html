  <h4>Minecraft Walkthrough</h4>
  <p class="article-card">
    This page shows you how to use the guides on this site to reach the end of the game and defeat the final boss. You
    can also use the achievements system as a sort of built-in walkthrough, but not all of the achievements are
    necessary. <br>
    The first thing you’ll need is to secure a source of food. A simple wheat farm will do the trick - build it
    underground under torchlight for safety.<br>
    It makes sense to also build a safe, underground tree farm. Once you have wood and food sources underground, you can
    stay in your mine until you have iron armour and weapons and a bow and arrows. No need to fight monsters n the
    surface until you’re ready.<br>
    Start digging! At first you mostly want iron, for tools and armour and to make a bucket to carry water to improve
    your farm. Next you want to dig down towards bedrock to establish a proper mine. Avoid underground structures on the
    way, or explore them and have adventures, it’s up to you. Your main goal is diamonds, however, and that means mining
    or exploring deep underground, near bedrock.<br>
    Once you have diamonds, you can mine some Obsidian, build a Nether Portal and head into The Nether to fight some
    Blazes. Be sure you are well-equipped first: iron or diamond weapons, and a bow and arrows.<br>
    Find a Stronghold and activate the End Portal. You may need to spens some time hunting Endermen at this point;
    that’s OK, you’re well-armed and armoured by now!<br>
    Equip yourself with top quality armor and weapons. Maybe some potions. And plenty of arrows! Venture through the End
    Portal and take on the Boss.<br>

  <h4>Iron-golem farm</h4>
  <p class="article-card">
    In Java Edition, a villager can attempt to spawn an iron golem while not having a golem alive within the box of
    radius 16 blocks around the villager and more than 30 seconds has passed.<br>
    An iron golem needs an available volume in which to spawn. There must be at least 3 transparent blocks above the
    spawning surface, and that surface must be solid and flat (but not a bottom slab).<br>
    Zombies and pillagers nearby increase the spawn rate of iron golems. If a zombie/pillager is seen by villagers, they
    panic and increase the rate of spawn attempts. Zombies are easier to use as scaring mobs than pillagers, as you'd
    need a disarmed pillager (one without crossbow) for the farm to work, although pillagers have a much larger range to
    scare villagers than zombies, also they don't burn in sunlight unlike zombies and won't hurt you if their crossbow
    breaks.<br>
    Nether portals can also be used to increase rates, since the iron golem cap instantly resets when it's teleported to
    the Nether. Aside portals, one can also construct a chute where the golems fall into after spawning, which clears
    the mob cap. This is more reliable than nether portals.<br>

  <h4>2x2 piston door</h4>
  <p class="article-card">
    To create a 2x2 piston door in Minecraft, players will need the following materials: Redstone dust, four sticky
    pistons, two redstone torches, four pressure plates, and eight blocks of their choice for the frame. Once players
    have gathered all the necessary ingredients, it's time to start building this highly secure and cool looking
    door.<br>
    First, players will want to dig out a hole that is two blocks wide and three blocks in height, going down two blocks
    deep. Next, from the middle of the three blocks, dig out two blocks on each side (still two blocks deep). If done
    correctly, this will look like a "+" sign.<br>
    Next, players will want to dig out one block on each of the "wings" of the hole, at the furthest block on each side.
    Then, place a redstone torch inside the hole. Cover the redstone torch with a block of the players choosing. Then,
    take the redstone dust and place it on each block inside the hole, including on top of the ones that are covering
    the redstone torches.<br>
    Now that players have the redstone in place, they should cover the hole with the blocks of their choice. Next, on
    the blocks near the ones with the redstone dust, players should stack two sticky pistons facing each other. Lastly,
    players should then place the blocks they wish the door to be on the sticky front part of the sticky pistons. If
    done correctly, the door will be closed at this time.<br>
    With the door correctly placed, it's time to activate it. Players should now place pressure plates directly in front
    of the door blocks on each side. If done this way, the door should now open from both sides. With a little bit of
    time and effort, players can make a 2x2 piston door in Minecraft. This project is a great way to add some extra
    security to their home, and it's not too difficult to do.<br>
