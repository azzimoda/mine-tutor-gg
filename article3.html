                    <h1 class="">2x2 piston door</h1>
                    <p> To create a 2x2 piston door in Minecraft, players will need the following materials: Redstone
                        dust, four sticky pistons, two redstone torches, four pressure plates, and eight blocks of their
                        choice for the frame. Once players have gathered all the necessary ingredients, it's time to
                        start building this highly secure and cool looking door. </p>
                    <p> First, players will want to dig out a hole that is two blocks wide and three blocks in height,
                        going down two blocks deep. Next, from the middle of the three blocks, dig out two blocks on
                        each side (still two blocks deep). If done correctly, this will look like a "+" sign. </p>
                    <p> Next, players will want to dig out one block on each of the "wings" of the hole, at the furthest
                        block on each side. Then, place a redstone torch inside the hole. Cover the redstone torch with
                        a block of the players choosing. Then, take the redstone dust and place it on each block inside
                        the hole, including on top of the ones that are covering the redstone torches. </p>
                    <p> Now that players have the redstone in place, they should cover the hole with the blocks of their
                        choice. Next, on the blocks near the ones with the redstone dust, players should stack two
                        sticky pistons facing each other. Lastly, players should then place the blocks they wish the
                        door to be on the sticky front part of the sticky pistons. If done correctly, the door will be
                        closed at this time. </p>
                    <p> With the door correctly placed, it's time to activate it. Players should now place pressure
                        plates directly in front of the door blocks on each side. If done this way, the door should now
                        open from both sides. With a little bit of time and effort, players can make a 2x2 piston door
                        in Minecraft. This project is a great way to add some extra security to their home, and it's not
                        too difficult to do. </p>
