                    <h1 class="title">Minecraft Walkthrough</h1>
                    <p> This page shows you how to use the guides on this site to reach the end of the game and defeat
                        the final boss. You can also use the achievements system as a sort of built-in walkthrough, but
                        not all of the achievements are necessary. </p>
                    <p> The first thing you'll need is to secure a source of food. A simple wheat farm will do the trick
                        - build it underground under torchlight for safety. </p>
                    <p> It makes sense to also build a safe, underground tree farm. Once you have wood and food sources
                        underground, you can stay in your mine until you have iron armour and weapons and a bow and
                        arrows. No need to fight monsters n the surface until you're ready. </p>
                    <p> Start digging! At first you mostly want iron, for tools and armour and to make a bucket to carry
                        water to improve your farm. Next you want to dig down towards bedrock to establish a proper
                        mine. Avoid underground structures on the way, or explore them and have adventures, it's up to
                        you. Your main goal is diamonds, however, and that means mining or exploring deep underground,
                        near bedrock. </p>
                    <p> Once you have diamonds, you can mine some Obsidian, build a Nether Portal and head into The
                        Nether to fight some Blazes. Be sure you are well-equipped first: iron or diamond weapons, and a
                        bow and arrows. </p>
                    <p> Find a Stronghold and activate the End Portal. You may need to spend some time hunting Endermen
                        at this point; that's OK, you're well-armed and armoured by now! </p>
                    <p> Equip yourself with top quality armor and weapons. Maybe some potions. And plenty of arrows!
                        Venture through the End Portal and take on the Boss. </p>
